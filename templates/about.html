                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>At SkinAI, we believe that early detection saves lives. Our mission is to leverage the power of artificial intelligence to provide accessible skin health education and empower individuals to be proactive about their skin health.</p>
                <p>Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer, with over 5 million cases diagnosed worldwide each year. When detected early, the 5-year survival rate for melanoma is over 99%. However, if it spreads to distant parts of the body, the survival rate drops to about 27%.</p>
                <p>By creating an educational tool that helps people understand potential skin concerns, we hope to encourage earlier medical consultations and improve outcomes through early detection.</p>
